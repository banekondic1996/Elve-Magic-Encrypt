Just vibe coded virtual image encryption/mounting app for my Linux DE (beta)<br> <br>
I got tired of creating .img disk image files using terminal, especially dynamic ones.<br>
Then i use ZuluCrypt to mount the images, but ZuluCrypt won't mount images without password. <br>
Well guess what? This simple web app can. <br>
Option to create link to physical drive was created, <br> 
cause i needed that many times for virtual machine + it will be usful for my DE.<br>
Option to mount .vdi and .vmdk will be added, and also bitlocker encrypted .vhd's (it's already there, but disabled)
<br><br>
**Dependencies to install:** <br>
<pre>
  cryptsetup
